OUR MILLING PROCESS
<br>
The Profile – A profile is the milled (cut) visible surface of the finished
<br>
material, which becomes part of the décor in your home. We have
<br>
hundreds of existing profiles in our profile library. We can design a
<br>
new profile by scanning a sample of material, an outline or sketch,
<br>
and creating a dimensional drawing in AutoCAD.
<br>
<br>
The Template – Using the AutoCAD drawing, we create a program
<br>
for our CNC router to carve the profile into a piece of cast acrylic
<br>
(plastic), creating a template. For replications, the original moulding
<br>
is tested against the template to ensure a match.
<br>
<br>
The Knife – Using the template, a steel plate is machined to create
<br>
the profile knife. The knife is inserted into a head that is placed into
<br>
a machine called a moulder, ready for production.
<br>
<br>
The Finished Product – Raw lumber is ripped (cut lengthwise) to
<br>
dimensions slightly larger than the finished moulding to minimize
<br>
waste during production. Rip off-cuts are used to make smaller
<br>
mouldings. The ripped lumber is fed through the moulder where the
<br>
knife heads rotate at high speeds carving the profile into the wood.
