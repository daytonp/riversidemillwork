<br>
From reach-in, to walk-in, to virtu-
<br>
ally livable dressing rooms, we can
<br>
help you bring your dream closet
<br>
into reality. For each design, we
<br>
create a 3D rendering of your
<br>
closet space, drawn to scale to
<br>
help you visualize the final prod-
<br>
uct. We work with you to suggest
<br>
layout options, advise on finishes,
<br>
and reconfigure the design until it’s
<br>
exactly suited to your needs.
<br>
<br>
Simplify your clothing storage with custom configured hanging and shelving options, tailored to your
<br>
wardrobe. Choose from top quality coated wire components, including sliding basket drawers and
<br>
angled shoe racks, or stylize your closet with one of our countless melamine finishes - from textured
<br>
wood grains and panels, to sleek high gloss in all the trending colours. We offer numerous built in
<br>
accessories to add practical functionality to your closet, including belt/tie hooks, valet rods, ironing
<br>
boards, hampers, mirrors, jewelry trays, etc.
