MOULDING REPLICATION
<br>
Wood mouldings are produced using sophisticated
<br>
software and machinery, requiring expertise in
<br>
design and engineering. We carefully monitor
<br>
consumer markets to ensure we optimize production
<br>
with the most popular profiles in the most desired
<br>
wood species. We incorporate both standard
<br>
profiles, as well as the latest interior décor trends into
<br>
our inventory, allowing us to offer competitive pricing
<br>
on beautifully crafted materials. Beyond stock
<br>
profiles however, lies the unbounded world of mould-
<br>
ing profile possibilities!
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group is capable of producing
<br>
virtually any style of wood moulding imaginable. Still,
<br>
perhaps more common than imagining a new profile,
<br>
our customers often come to us in search of the past
<br>
– interested in replicating mouldings as part of an
<br>
older home restoration or renovation. Though the
<br>
milling craft has changed somewhat since last centu-
<br>
ry, our replications can blend seamlessly with the
<br>
grandeur of your historic mouldings allowing you to
<br>
honour the unique character of your home.
