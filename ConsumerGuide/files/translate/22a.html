The Mudroom
<br>
If your mudroom looks like a scene from a sci-fi movie where the humans have been
<br>
vaporized and all that remains is a scatter of coats, shoes, and bags… then you’re like
<br>
just about every other family! Coming home to a pile of ‘stuff’ at the door is frustrating,
<br>
not to mention trying to get out that door in the morning with everything everyone needs.
<br>
<br>
But it doesn’t have to be that way. The family ‘locker room’ has been growing in populari-
<br>
ty for one important reason – it really works! Creating an attractive, practical, and
<br>
easy-to-use space to store your daily use items will engage your whole family in the art
<br>
of being organized.
<br>
<br>
Our storage design team guides you through the process of creating the ideal mudroom
<br>
storage system for your family, incorporating materials and finishes which complement
<br>
your interior décor.
<br>
<br>
Individual lockers allow you easy access to the items you
<br>
need, right where you need them to be.
<br>
<br>
Multiple hooks per locker offer hanging options for jackets,
<br>
umbrellas, back-packs, hats, your dog’s leash, your
<br>
daughter’s helmet – anything you want to be able to grab
<br>
and go.
<br>
<br>
Overhead cupboards allow you to tuck away off-season
<br>
items, while keeping them sorted for each family member.
<br>
<br>
A built-in bench offers a comfortable place to sit and tie
<br>
shoes. Add drawers and recessed shelves below the bench to
<br>
easily store extra footwear.
<br>
<br>
Entertainment Units
<br>
We’ve come a long way since the days of
<br>
the floor model T.V. set, where audio,
<br>
visual, and operating components were all
<br>
rolled into one handsome, woodgrain
<br>
console. In today’s home, with entertain-
<br>
ment device options as diverse as the
<br>
users, the need for a customized way to
<br>
organize these items has never been great-
<br>
er. No need to get rid of your cd or vinyl
<br>
collection - as part of your living space, we
<br>
can incorporate discreet storage elements
<br>
into your entertainment unit to keep the
<br>
clutter out of sight. We offer the same great
<br>
design-build process for entertainment
<br>
units as we do for all other storage systems.
<br>
<br>
Choose from hundreds of beautiful finishes,
<br>
hardware options, and even introduce
<br>
built-in lighting to enhance functionality and
<br>
style. RIVERSIDE MILLWORK GROUP
