OUR MILLING PROCESS
<br>
The Profile – A profile is the milled (cut) visible surface of the finished
<br>
material, which becomes part of the décor in your home. We have
<br>
hundreds of existing profiles in our profile library. We can design a
<br>
new profile by scanning a sample of material, an outline or sketch,
<br>
and creating a dimensional drawing in AutoCAD.
<br>
<br>
The Template – Using the AutoCAD drawing, we create a program
<br>
for our CNC router to carve the profile into a piece of cast acrylic
<br>
(plastic), creating a template. For replications, the original moulding
<br>
is tested against the template to ensure a match.
<br>
<br>
The Knife – Using the template, a steel plate is machined to create
<br>
the profile knife. The knife is inserted into a head that is placed into
<br>
a machine called a moulder, ready for production.
<br>
<br>
The Finished Product – Raw lumber is ripped (cut lengthwise) to
<br>
dimensions slightly larger than the finished moulding to minimize
<br>
waste during production. Rip off-cuts are used to make smaller
<br>
mouldings. The ripped lumber is fed through the moulder where the
<br>
knife heads rotate at high speeds carving the profile into the wood.

MOULDING REPLICATION
<br>
Wood mouldings are produced using sophisticated
<br>
software and machinery, requiring expertise in
<br>
design and engineering. We carefully monitor
<br>
consumer markets to ensure we optimize production
<br>
with the most popular profiles in the most desired
<br>
wood species. We incorporate both standard
<br>
profiles, as well as the latest interior décor trends into
<br>
our inventory, allowing us to offer competitive pricing
<br>
on beautifully crafted materials. Beyond stock
<br>
profiles however, lies the unbounded world of mould-
<br>
ing profile possibilities!
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group is capable of producing
<br>
virtually any style of wood moulding imaginable. Still,
<br>
perhaps more common than imagining a new profile,
<br>
our customers often come to us in search of the past
<br>
– interested in replicating mouldings as part of an
<br>
older home restoration or renovation. Though the
<br>
milling craft has changed somewhat since last centu-
<br>
ry, our replications can blend seamlessly with the
<br>
grandeur of your historic mouldings allowing you to
<br>
honour the unique character of your home.
