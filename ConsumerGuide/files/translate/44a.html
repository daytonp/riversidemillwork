Style is in the
<br>
details. Schlage believes that the “finishing
<br>
touch” is just as important as the first.
<br>
<br>
Which is why we make distinctive
<br>
door hardware designed not just to
<br>
match your personal style, but to
<br>
welcome you home. From classic looks
<br>
that never go out of style to bold
<br>
contemporary designs, our hardware
<br>
fits and accentuates virtually any décor.
