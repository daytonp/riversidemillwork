OUR VALUE
<br>
Working with us
<br>
Philosophy At Riverside Millwork Group, our project management philosophy is
<br>
simple; every project has a unique solution, which we arrive at with
<br>
you. Our products and services become part of your home, part of
<br>
your family life. When you entrust us with that opportunity, we
<br>
commit ourselves to taking a consultative approach to finding that
<br>
solution – ensuring clear communication with you throughout the
<br>
entire process. We understand that each customer has unique
<br>
needs that often require us to challenge our boundaries and explore
<br>
new concepts. No matter how challenging a project can be, we pride
<br>
ourselves on upholding the highest standards of customer service.
<br>
<br>
Experience The collective years of experience at Riverside Millwork Group can
<br>
literally be measured in centuries! A great many of our staff ‘cut their
<br>
teeth’ in the woodworking industry, having dedicated themselves to
<br>
life-long careers in our operations, becoming masters of their craft
<br>
and mentors for their team members. Similarly, our sales team
<br>
includes experienced trades and craftspeople who are fully versed
<br>
both on and off the tools, enabling them to educate our customers
<br>
resulting in improved and inspired project solutions.
<br>
<br>
Innovation Riverside Millwork Group believes in continuous improvement; of our
<br>
products, our process, and of ourselves. We are a diverse team of
<br>
professionals committed to keeping our skills and technologies rele-
<br>
vant, and we strive to be leaders of innovation in our industry. We
<br>
have developed our project management process through years of
<br>
refinement and practice. If something doesn’t work, we fix it –
<br>
assessing problem areas allows us to anticipate future challenges
<br>
and strengthen our process to improve our customer service.
<br>
<br>
Success What sets us apart from our competitors is our consultative approach
<br>
to project management. From the early concept stage, through
<br>
design, manufacturing, delivery and installation, we are in constant
<br>
communication with our customer – confirming every detail along the
<br>
way. We are committed to providing the best possible value, and we
<br>
do this by suggesting products and services that we believe are best
<br>
suited to your needs. So often we have customers telling us that
<br>
they had a very different idea of what they needed before they began
<br>
working with us, and end up being thrilled with a final product they
<br>
had a part in creating.
