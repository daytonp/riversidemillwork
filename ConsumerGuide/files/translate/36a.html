The French door
<br>
was originally developed
<br>
as a way to allow natural light to travel through to
<br>
the interior of the home. Whether used to sepa-
<br>
rate a formal dining area, highlight the entrance to
<br>
a library, or allow visibility from a home office,
<br>
French doors will not only serve their original
<br>
purpose, but also become a focal point of beauty
<br>
in your home. French doors can be used for single
<br>
or double openings, and are available in both paint
<br>
grade and stain grade wood species.
