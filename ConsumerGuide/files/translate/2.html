INTRODUCING
<br>
RIVERSIDE MILLWORK GROUP
<br>
Our Story
<br>
Riverside Door & Trim began business in Kitchener, Ontario, in May of 2005
<br>
as a trim and door contracting company. The first decade of operation saw
<br>
Riverside achieve significant growth, which included relocating to the current
<br>
facility in Waterloo. Progressively along the way, new products and technol-
<br>
ogies were adopted to support the evolving needs of the interior building
<br>
materials consumer market.
<br>
<br>
More than a generation earlier, County Heritage Forest Products (est. 1976
<br>
in London, Ontario) began a long standing tradition of providing quality
<br>
manufactured interior building materials and service to the Southwestern
<br>
Ontario market.
<br>
<br>
In June of 2015 Riverside and County merged operations, and began to
<br>
shape the next chapter of this story now known as Riverside Millwork Group.
