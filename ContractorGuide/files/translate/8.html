VALUE ADDED SERVICES
<br>
Supply & Install Service
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group provides installation of our
<br>
products for new home construction and complete renova-
<br>
tion projects. Installation services are not available for small
<br>
product installations or renovations where home owners are
<br>
living in the home. We have both in-house and subcontract
<br>
finish carpenters available for customers who wish to
<br>
package their product and installation into one order. This
<br>
service carries a one year installation warranty in addition to
<br>
any manufacturer warranties, and is coordinated by an
<br>
experienced foreman to manage the job. For customers
<br>
who wish to manage their own carpentry, Riverside is happy
<br>
to work directly with your finish carpenter of choice. This
<br>
option still receives the same consultative sales experience
<br>
but with no oversight of the installation work. All installations
<br>
should be booked a least 15 business days in advance.
<br>
<br>
Mill Moulding Supply Lengths
<br>
Unless specified, Riverside will supply random lengths for
<br>
mill mouldings ranging from 3 to 16 lineal feet. Although we
<br>
make every effort to supply the longest available lengths in
<br>
mill material, please anticipate up to 15% of your order to be
<br>
comprised of ‘shorts’ (3 to 10 lineal feet). If necessary,
<br>
please specify the lengths required for your project when
<br>
you place your order. Orders with specified length require-
<br>
ments are subject to a surcharge of up to 15%.
<br>
<br>
For casing, jambs and doorstop you may order lengths in
<br>
ranges to avoid possible surcharges. For example, you can
<br>
order 7 to 8 foot material for standard 6’8” doors, or 9 to 10
<br>
foot material for 7’0” to 8’0” doors. In these cases, you will
<br>
be charged for the greater length but would avoid the speci-
<br>
fied length surcharge. We also offer the option of ordering
<br>
these materials in ‘sets’ where a combination of materials of
<br>
appropriate length required for one opening are bundled
<br>
together for you, allowing for easier distribution of materials
<br>
on site. A small surcharge is carried for this option, but
<br>
returns value on site for the finish carpenter.
