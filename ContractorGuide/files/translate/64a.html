HOW TO STORE, HANDLE, CARE FOR,

<br>
YOUR WOOD DOOR
<br>
LIMITED WARRANTY
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group produces doors of the highest
<br>
quality and warrants – subject to the conditions and restric-
<br>
tions outlined herein – that all doors manufactured and sold
<br>
by Riverside Millwork Group shall be free from defects in
<br>
materials and workmanship for five years for interior doors
<br>
and 2 years for exterior doors that are finished properly from
<br>
the time of manufacturing. If any door manufactured by
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group fails to conform to this warranty,
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group will repair or replace the doors. If
<br>
repair or replacement is not practical, Riverside Millwork
<br>
Group will refund the purchase price of the doors. This
<br>
warranty does not cover any other cost such as re-finishing,
<br>
re-hanging, or anything related to the repair, replacement,
<br>
or refund of the door. Riverside Millwork Group will not be
<br>
liable for any door repaired or replaced without its prior
<br>
written consent. The purchaser, upon receipt of the doors,
<br>
should inspect each door individually. Also, nature creates,
<br>
but never duplicates so two pieces of wood (even from the
<br>
same tree) are never exactly alike. Due to the differences in
<br>
natural colour and grain each piece of wood will react differ-
<br>
ently to the finishing materials used. This means that you
<br>
may notice a slight difference in colour between several
<br>
pieces. In addition, sound knots, slight surface cracks and
<br>
other imperfections are true characteristics of quality wood
<br>
products and thus these are natural imperfections – not
<br>
defects. 64

THIS WARRANTY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE
<br>
FOLLOWING TERMS & CONDITIONS:
<br>
1. STORAGE & HANDLING
<br>
Doors must be handled with care – preferably with 2
<br>
people handling, as they are heavy.
<br>
<br>
Doors must be stored horizontally on a flat, dry, and
<br>
clean surface until hanging.
<br>
<br>
Doors must not be slid on, over, or under each other as
<br>
scratching will likely occur.
<br>
<br>
Doors must not be dragged across floors or any other
<br>
surface as scratching will likely occur.
<br>
<br>
Doors must not be subjected to extreme heat, humidity,
<br>
dryness, direct sunlight or cold.
<br>
<br>
Doors must be stored flat, at least 4” off the floor, on a
<br>
dry, clean, and well ventilated area protected from the
<br>
sun, wide ranges of humidity, and abnormal heat or cold.
<br>
<br>
Relative humidity cannot exceed 55% and should be no
<br>
less than 25%.
<br>
<br>
2. TOLERANCES
<br>
Size tolerance: Thickness, length and width plus or
<br>
minus 1 / 16 ”.
<br>
<br>
Squareness tolerance: diagonal measurement difference
<br>
will not exceed 1 / 8 ”.
<br>
<br>
Hinge and lockset cutout preparation by Riverside
<br>
Millwork Group will have a tolerance of plus or
<br>
minus 1 / 32 ”.
<br>
<br>
Warpage will not be considered a defect unless it
<br>
exceeds 1 / 4 ” in the plane of the door. For doors 1 3 / 4 ” or
<br>
thicker, warp will not exceed 1 / 4 ” in doors 3’6” x 7’0” or
<br>
smaller, nor will it exceed 1 / 4 ” in any section of a door
<br>
larger than 3’6” x 7’0”. For doors less than 1 3 / 4 ” thick,
<br>
warp will not exceed 1 / 4 ” doors smaller than 3’0” x 7’0”.
<br>
<br>
Warping is measured by placing a straight edge on the
<br>
concave face and determining the maximum distance
<br>
from the straight edge on the concave face and determin-
<br>
ing the maximum distance from the straight edge to door
<br>
face. www.riversidemillwork.ca
