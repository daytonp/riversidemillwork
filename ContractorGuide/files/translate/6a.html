Custom Tooling
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group has been making custom mould-
<br>
ings for nearly 40 years, and as a result we have accumu-
<br>
lated thousands of profiles. We’ve provided a vast selec-
<br>
tion of hundreds of our profiles in this book and on our
<br>
website, but if you can’t find what you’re looking for, ask
<br>
your sales representative for access to our profile vault. If
<br>
you still can’t find what you need, we can custom create
<br>
new mouldings from scratch using AutoCAD and CNC
<br>
technologies. Please inquire for more details.
<br>
<br>
Door Machining & Pre-Built Frames
<br>
We have the latest technology in CNC door machining
<br>
equipment which allows us to pre-machine both doors and
<br>
jambs for hinges, locksets (cylindrical or mortise), flushbolts
<br>
and almost any other hardware upon request. We can also
<br>
pre-build frames with casing pre-mitred and attached to
<br>
jamb sets upon request. Using pre-machined doors and
<br>
pre-built frames can save significant amounts of time in the
<br>
installation process. Please inquire for more details about
<br>
our machining services.
<br>
<br>
Wood Species Availability
<br>
We regularly stock mouldings in common wood species like
<br>
poplar and oak. With the help of our vendor partner
<br>
network, we are able to source any wood species available
<br>
in the marketplace, such as maple, cherry, mahogany and
<br>
more to create mouldings and doors. We are able to
<br>
provide manageable timelines for acquiring whichever
<br>
wood species you require for your project.
<br>
<br>
