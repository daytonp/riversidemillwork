3. CARE & FINISHING (CONTINUED)
<br>
Signs that the finish has failed include:
<br>
Grain raising - When the surface of the wood appears rough or
<br>
cracked where it was previously smooth. This is an indicator
<br>
that moisture has been absorbed by the door through the
<br>
surface of the wood. Discolouration – If the door has taken a
<br>
grayish hue or discolouration other than that what would
<br>
naturally occur with some species when exposed to light (cher-
<br>
ry and sapele will become darker red, walnut will blacken), the
<br>
door has oxidized due to exposure to moisture or humidity.
<br>
<br>
Flaking or cracking – If cracks in the finish of the urethane or
<br>
varnish appear, moisture will get into the wood. This should be
<br>
sanded and refinished immediately when noticed.
<br>
<br>
Due to conditions beyond our control, most finishes on exterior
<br>
doors deteriorate relatively quickly. Inspect the condition of
<br>
exterior finishes at least once a year and refinish as often as
<br>
needed to maintain the protective integrity of the finish.
<br>
<br>
4. INSTALLATION
<br>
The integrity or structural strength of the doors must not be
<br>
compromised in fitting to the opening, or in applying hardware,
<br>
preparing for lites, louvers, plantons or other detailing. All
<br>
products must be installed by an experienced door installer.
<br>
<br>
Installer must drill pilot holes before installing hinges. Check
<br>
screw or hinge manufacturer’s recommendations for size of
<br>
pilot holes required. Failure to drill pilot holes can result in the
<br>
door cracking, voiding all warranties. The following quantity
<br>
and size/type of hinge should be used on the following door
