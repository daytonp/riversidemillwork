VALUE ADDED SERVICES
<br>
Supply & Install Service
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group provides installation of our
<br>
products for new home construction and complete renova-
<br>
tion projects. Installation services are not available for small
<br>
product installations or renovations where home owners are
<br>
living in the home. We have both in-house and subcontract
<br>
finish carpenters available for customers who wish to
<br>
package their product and installation into one order. This
<br>
service carries a one year installation warranty in addition to
<br>
any manufacturer warranties, and is coordinated by an
<br>
experienced foreman to manage the job. For customers
<br>
who wish to manage their own carpentry, Riverside is happy
<br>
to work directly with your finish carpenter of choice. This
<br>
option still receives the same consultative sales experience
<br>
but with no oversight of the installation work. All installations
<br>
should be booked a least 15 business days in advance.
<br>
<br>
Mill Moulding Supply Lengths
<br>
Unless specified, Riverside will supply random lengths for
<br>
mill mouldings ranging from 3 to 16 lineal feet. Although we
<br>
make every effort to supply the longest available lengths in
<br>
mill material, please anticipate up to 15% of your order to be
<br>
comprised of ‘shorts’ (3 to 10 lineal feet). If necessary,
<br>
please specify the lengths required for your project when
<br>
you place your order. Orders with specified length require-
<br>
ments are subject to a surcharge of up to 15%.
<br>
<br>
For casing, jambs and doorstop you may order lengths in
<br>
ranges to avoid possible surcharges. For example, you can
<br>
order 7 to 8 foot material for standard 6’8” doors, or 9 to 10
<br>
foot material for 7’0” to 8’0” doors. In these cases, you will
<br>
be charged for the greater length but would avoid the speci-
<br>
fied length surcharge. We also offer the option of ordering
<br>
these materials in ‘sets’ where a combination of materials of
<br>
appropriate length required for one opening are bundled
<br>
together for you, allowing for easier distribution of materials
<br>
on site. A small surcharge is carried for this option, but
<br>
returns value on site for the finish carpenter.

Project Specifications
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group makes every effort to ensure that
<br>
all project specifications are accurate and communicated
<br>
properly through our supply chain. We require customer
<br>
final approval of all specifications prior to materials being
<br>
procured or manufactured. We have created this Contractor
<br>
Product Guide along with our Consumer Product Guide to
<br>
assist our customers in their product selection process.
<br>
<br>
Please be advised that all information provided here, in our
<br>
Consumer Product Guide and on our website (errors and
<br>
omissions excepted) is subject to change without notice,
<br>
and thereby we cannot be held liable for any costs that may
<br>
arise from specification changes to products within our
<br>
literature. With your sales representative, please confirm all
<br>
specifications, quantities, delivery requirements, custom
<br>
manufactured product details, and pricing prior to finalizing
<br>
your order. We believe in building long term partnerships
<br>
with our customers, built on the basis of mutual expectation
<br>
of clear communication.

Custom Woodworking
<br>
Arches, Curves, Carvings, Century Replication
<br>

<br>
manufacturing and installing interior millwork products with
<br>
the firm belief that nothing can ever be too custom. We take
<br>
great pride in knowing that our craftsmanship can create
<br>
that one of a kind piece that becomes a conversation starter
<br>

<br>
technology in our moulding, door and panel manufacturing
<br>
processes, coupled with our unrelenting commitment to
<br>
quality, we provide our customers the most unique pieces to
<br>
suit any type of project – from modest, to very high end.
<br>
<br>
Century replication is a regular part of our production.
<br>
<br>
Curved or arched mouldings can be made by hand or on
<br>
CNC equipment, depending on the application. Ask one of
<br>
our sales representatives or visit one of our two retail
<br>

<br>
create your unique products.
