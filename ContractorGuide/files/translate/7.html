<br>
Payment & Accounts
<br>
For all non-account (COD) orders over $3,000.00, a non-re-
<br>
fundable deposit of 50% is due at the time of order, with the
<br>
balance due the day before delivery. COD orders less than
<br>
$3,000.00 must be paid in full at the time of order. Custom-
<br>
ers may wish to set up a credit account to make future
<br>
purchases. To establish a credit account, a Riverside
<br>
Millwork Group Credit Application must be completed and
<br>
submitted to our Finance department for approval. Orders
<br>
placed prior to receipt of approved credit will be treated as
<br>
COD orders, and deposit rules will apply. All custom
<br>
(non-stock) orders are non-refundable.
<br>
<br>
Delivery Charges
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group applies a flat rate delivery charge
<br>
of $75.00 for each on site delivery within our regular service
<br>
area that is a special trip. However, if you do not need a
<br>
specific delivery date and your materials can be added to
<br>
one of our regular delivery routes the delivery charge can be
<br>
waived. Additional delivery charges will apply for deliveries
<br>
outside of our regular service area. Customers are respon-
<br>
sible for ensuring there is adequate space at the delivery
<br>
site to accept their materials, and adequate access to that
<br>
space. Riverside Millwork Group reserves the right to
<br>
refuse delivery of materials if upon arrival at the predeter-
<br>
mined site conditions are deemed to be unsafe (including
<br>
but not limited to: entrance obstructed by other vehicles,
<br>
scaffolding, overhead wires, absence of proper safety
<br>
railing, etc.). Please inquire with your sales representative
<br>
or at either of our two retail locations for more details.
<br>
<br>
Warranty & Returns
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group must be notified of any material
<br>
shortages, defective, or damaged materials within 48 hours
<br>
of delivery. Riverside will not be held liable for any damage
<br>
caused after delivery including but not limited to: incorrect
<br>
storage, handling, installation, or finishing of materials.
<br>
<br>
Upon authorization from Riverside for a return, Riverside will
<br>

<br>
original condition (un-cut/drilled, un-painted, not damaged)
<br>

<br>

<br>
purchase price can apply to cover handling costs. For more
<br>
