3. CARE & FINISHING
<br>
Doors are provided to the customer in good condition, and
<br>
care has been taken in selecting the wood and machining it to
<br>
a high quality finish. However, they should not be considered
<br>
ready for finish when initially received. Ensure that the doors
<br>
have been allowed to adapt to stable moisture content. Doors
<br>
must be completely block sanded on all surfaces with 220 grit
<br>
abrasive sandpaper to remove all handling marks, raised grain
<br>
and other undesirable blemishes prior to finishing. All exposed
<br>
surfaces must be sealed, including the top and bottom of door
<br>
(rails) with a non-water based seal or primer. The door surface
<br>
should be satisfactory in both smoothness and colour before
<br>
applying the next coat. Be sure coat is dry and hard before
<br>
applying the next coat. Always obtain and follow paint manu-
<br>
facturer’s recommendations. Never attempt to paint doors in
<br>
moist conditions. Paint will not dry quickly enough and will
<br>
penetrate into the door to cause expansion. For exterior doors,
<br>
two coats of high quality exterior grade sealer or primer must
<br>
be applied as soon as the doors arrive at the job site, or before
<br>
they go to the job site. Many exterior finishes are designed to
<br>
penetrate into the wood and protect the surface of the door(s).
<br>
<br>
A urethane finish is suggested for exterior applications. A
<br>
minimum of 3 coats is suggested. It should also be noted that
<br>
the stain does not give any protection to the wood but only
<br>
alters the colour. Only urethane and varnish will protect the
<br>
wood. As a rule of thumb, an average life expectancy for a
<br>
finish is 2-3 years. After this point the finish loses its effective-
<br>
ness and is no longer protecting the door making it susceptible
<br>
to rotting. The door(s) must be refinished properly on a regular
<br>
basis to live a long life. Wood is a natural product and reacts
<br>
differently to changes in humidity and temperature. The
<br>
components of the door (stiles, rails and panels) expand and
<br>
contract as these conditions change. When fitting the door(s),
<br>
please keep these expansions and contractions in mind to
<br>
prevent the need for re-fitment. The panels may reduce in size
<br>
leaving an unfinished area exposed. This unfinished area
<br>
should be touched up with stain and sealer/urethane during
<br>
the first dry season after installation to eliminate any further
<br>
exposure of raw wood.
