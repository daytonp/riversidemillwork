Project Specifications
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group makes every effort to ensure that
<br>
all project specifications are accurate and communicated
<br>
properly through our supply chain. We require customer
<br>
final approval of all specifications prior to materials being
<br>
procured or manufactured. We have created this Contractor
<br>
Product Guide along with our Consumer Product Guide to
<br>
assist our customers in their product selection process.
<br>
<br>
Please be advised that all information provided here, in our
<br>
Consumer Product Guide and on our website (errors and
<br>
omissions excepted) is subject to change without notice,
<br>
and thereby we cannot be held liable for any costs that may
<br>
arise from specification changes to products within our
<br>
literature. With your sales representative, please confirm all
<br>
specifications, quantities, delivery requirements, custom
<br>
manufactured product details, and pricing prior to finalizing
<br>
your order. We believe in building long term partnerships
<br>
with our customers, built on the basis of mutual expectation
<br>
of clear communication.

<br>
