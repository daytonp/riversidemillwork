<br>
YOUR WOOD DOOR
<br>
LIMITED WARRANTY
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group produces doors of the highest
<br>
quality and warrants – subject to the conditions and restric-
<br>
tions outlined herein – that all doors manufactured and sold
<br>
by Riverside Millwork Group shall be free from defects in
<br>
materials and workmanship for five years for interior doors
<br>
and 2 years for exterior doors that are finished properly from
<br>
the time of manufacturing. If any door manufactured by
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group fails to conform to this warranty,
<br>
Riverside Millwork Group will repair or replace the doors. If
<br>
repair or replacement is not practical, Riverside Millwork
<br>
Group will refund the purchase price of the doors. This
<br>
warranty does not cover any other cost such as re-finishing,
<br>
re-hanging, or anything related to the repair, replacement,
<br>
or refund of the door. Riverside Millwork Group will not be
<br>
liable for any door repaired or replaced without its prior
<br>
written consent. The purchaser, upon receipt of the doors,
<br>
should inspect each door individually. Also, nature creates,
<br>
but never duplicates so two pieces of wood (even from the
<br>
same tree) are never exactly alike. Due to the differences in
<br>
natural colour and grain each piece of wood will react differ-
<br>
ently to the finishing materials used. This means that you
<br>
may notice a slight difference in colour between several
<br>
pieces. In addition, sound knots, slight surface cracks and
<br>
other imperfections are true characteristics of quality wood
<br>
products and thus these are natural imperfections – not
<br>
defects. 64
