		<td>INTRODUCING RIVERSIDE MILLWORK GROUP Our Story Riverside Door &amp; Trim began business in Kitchener, Ontario, in May of 2005 as a trim and door contracting company. The first decade of operation saw Riverside achieve significant growth, which included relocating to the current facility in Waterloo. Progressively along the way, new products and technol- ogies were adopted to support the evolving needs of the interior building materials consumer market. More than a generation earlier, County Heritage Forest Products (est. 1976 in London, Ontario) began a long standing tradition of providing quality manufactured interior building materials and service to the Southwestern Ontario market. In June of 2015 Riverside and County merged operations, and began to shape the next chapter of this story now known as Riverside Millwork Group. Riverside Millwork Group Today Dedicated to the highest standards of quality and customer service. Two locations, totaling over 100,000 square feet. Spacious product showrooms, open to the public at both locations. Experienced and creative staff available to advise and assist Monday to Saturday. Complementing manufacturing operations in Waterloo and London, producing a full range of millwork products. Leading edge woodworking machinery and design software.

		<td>VALUE ADDED SERVICES Custom Tooling   Riverside Millwork Group has been making custom mould- ings for nearly 40 years, and as a result we have accumu- lated thousands of profiles. We’ve provided a vast selec- tion of hundreds of our profiles in this book and on our website, but if you can’t find what you’re looking for, ask your sales representative for access to our profile vault. If you still can’t find what you need, we can custom create new mouldings from scratch using AutoCAD and CNC technologies. Please inquire for more details. Door Machining &amp; Pre-Built Frames We have the latest technology in CNC door machining equipment which allows us to pre-machine both doors and jambs for hinges, locksets (cylindrical or mortise), flushbolts and almost any other hardware upon request. We can also pre-build frames with casing pre-mitred and attached to jamb sets upon request. Using pre-machined doors and pre-built frames can save significant amounts of time in the installation process. Please inquire for more details about our machining services. Wood Species Availability We regularly stock mouldings in common wood species like poplar and oak. With the help of our vendor partner network, we are able to source any wood species available in the marketplace, such as maple, cherry, mahogany and more to create mouldings and doors. We are able to provide manageable timelines for acquiring whichever wood species you require for your project. Consultative Selling Service A   t Riverside Millwork Group we don’t just sell you products. We ask plenty of questions and challenge your requests to ensure that we are providing you with the best value possi- ble. More than just ‘order takers’, our sales representatives are trained millwork professionals who can advise you on practical solutions while accommodating the design requirements of your project. Request a free consultation today and experience the difference for yourself. Delivery Fleet D   ispatching from both Waterloo and London, Riverside has a large delivery fleet offering expedited delivery across Southwestern Ontario, Northern New York and Northern Michigan. We have regularly scheduled routes to major city centres throughout our service areas and availability to accommodate short notice requests on a local scale. 6 www.riversidemillwork.ca </td>

		<td>VALUE ADDED SERVICES Payment &amp; Accounts For all non-account (COD) orders over $3,000.00, a non-re- fundable deposit of 50% is due at the time of order, with the balance due the day before delivery. COD orders less than $3,000.00 must be paid in full at the time of order. Custom- ers may wish to set up a credit account to make future purchases. To establish a credit account, a Riverside Millwork Group Credit Application must be completed and submitted to our Finance department for approval. Orders placed prior to receipt of approved credit will be treated as COD orders, and deposit rules will apply. All custom (non-stock) orders are non-refundable. Delivery Charges Riverside Millwork Group applies a flat rate delivery charge of $75.00 for each on site delivery within our regular service area that is a special trip. However, if you do not need a specific delivery date and your materials can be added to one of our regular delivery routes the delivery charge can be waived. Additional delivery charges will apply for deliveries outside of our regular service area. Customers are respon- sible for ensuring there is adequate space at the delivery site to accept their materials, and adequate access to that space. Riverside Millwork Group reserves the right to refuse delivery of materials if upon arrival at the predeter- mined site conditions are deemed to be unsafe (including but not limited to: entrance obstructed by other vehicles, scaffolding, overhead wires, absence of proper safety railing, etc.). Please inquire with your sales representative or at either of our two retail locations for more details. Warranty &amp; Returns Riverside Millwork Group must be notified of any material shortages, defective, or damaged materials within 48 hours of delivery. Riverside will not be held liable for any damage caused after delivery including but not limited to: incorrect storage, handling, installation, or finishing of materials. Upon authorization from Riverside for a return, Riverside will credit products that are stock (non-custom) and in their original condition (un-cut/drilled, un-painted, not damaged) so long as the products are in completely saleable condi- tion. Re-stocking fees from 20 – 50% of the original purchase price can apply to cover handling costs. For more details about our product warranties please visit our website, or the websites of our vendor partners. www.riversidemillwork.ca 7 </td>

		<td>VALUE ADDED SERVICES Supply &amp; Install Service Riverside Millwork Group provides installation of our products for new home construction and complete renova- tion projects. Installation services are not available for small product installations or renovations where home owners are living in the home. We have both in-house and subcontract finish carpenters available for customers who wish to package their product and installation into one order. This service carries a one year installation warranty in addition to any manufacturer warranties, and is coordinated by an experienced foreman to manage the job. For customers who wish to manage their own carpentry, Riverside is happy to work directly with your finish carpenter of choice. This option still receives the same consultative sales experience but with no oversight of the installation work. All installations should be booked a least 15 business days in advance. Mill Moulding Supply Lengths Unless specified, Riverside will supply random lengths for mill mouldings ranging from 3 to 16 lineal feet. Although we make every effort to supply the longest available lengths in mill material, please anticipate up to 15% of your order to be comprised of ‘shorts’ (3 to 10 lineal feet). If necessary, please specify the lengths required for your project when you place your order. Orders with specified length require- ments are subject to a surcharge of up to 15%. For casing, jambs and doorstop you may order lengths in ranges to avoid possible surcharges. For example, you can order 7 to 8 foot material for standard 6’8” doors, or 9 to 10 foot material for 7’0” to 8’0” doors. In these cases, you will be charged for the greater length but would avoid the speci- fied length surcharge. We also offer the option of ordering these materials in ‘sets’ where a combination of materials of appropriate length required for one opening are bundled together for you, allowing for easier distribution of materials on site. A small surcharge is carried for this option, but returns value on site for the finish carpenter. 8 www.riversidemillwork.ca </td>

		<td>VALUE ADDED SERVICES Project Specifications Riverside Millwork Group makes every effort to ensure that all project specifications are accurate and communicated properly through our supply chain. We require customer final approval of all specifications prior to materials being procured or manufactured. We have created this Contractor Product Guide along with our Consumer Product Guide to assist our customers in their product selection process. Please be advised that all information provided here, in our Consumer Product Guide and on our website (errors and omissions excepted) is subject to change without notice, and thereby we cannot be held liable for any costs that may arise from specification changes to products within our literature. With your sales representative, please confirm all specifications, quantities, delivery requirements, custom manufactured product details, and pricing prior to finalizing your order. We believe in building long term partnerships with our customers, built on the basis of mutual expectation of clear communication. Custom Woodworking Arches, Curves, Carvings, Century Replication For nearly 40 years Riverside Millwork Group has been manufacturing and installing interior millwork products with the firm belief that nothing can ever be too custom. We take great pride in knowing that our craftsmanship can create that one of a kind piece that becomes a conversation starter in your home. Using the latest in CNC and AutoCAD technology in our moulding, door and panel manufacturing processes, coupled with our unrelenting commitment to quality, we provide our customers the most unique pieces to suit any type of project – from modest, to very high end. Century replication is a regular part of our production. Curved or arched mouldings can be made by hand or on CNC equipment, depending on the application. Ask one of our sales representatives or visit one of our two retail locations for more information about how we can help you create your unique products. www.riversidemillwork.ca 9 </td>

		<td>INTERIOR MILL DOORS HOW TO STORE, HANDLE, CARE FOR, FINISH, INSTALL &amp; MAINTAIN YOUR WOOD DOOR LIMITED WARRANTY Riverside Millwork Group produces doors of the highest quality and warrants – subject to the conditions and restric- tions outlined herein – that all doors manufactured and sold by Riverside Millwork Group shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship for five years for interior doors and 2 years for exterior doors that are finished properly from the time of manufacturing. If any door manufactured by Riverside Millwork Group fails to conform to this warranty, Riverside Millwork Group will repair or replace the doors. If repair or replacement is not practical, Riverside Millwork Group will refund the purchase price of the doors. This warranty does not cover any other cost such as re-finishing, re-hanging, or anything related to the repair, replacement, or refund of the door. Riverside Millwork Group will not be liable for any door repaired or replaced without its prior written consent. The purchaser, upon receipt of the doors, should inspect each door individually. Also, nature creates, but never duplicates so two pieces of wood (even from the same tree) are never exactly alike. Due to the differences in natural colour and grain each piece of wood will react differ- ently to the finishing materials used. This means that you may notice a slight difference in colour between several pieces. In addition, sound knots, slight surface cracks and other imperfections are true characteristics of quality wood products and thus these are natural imperfections – not defects. 64 www.riversidemillwork.ca </td>

	<tr id="sr-65">
		<td>INTERIOR MILL DOORS THIS WARRANTY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS: 1. STORAGE &amp; HANDLING Doors must be handled with care – preferably with 2 people handling, as they are heavy. Doors must be stored horizontally on a flat, dry, and clean surface until hanging. Doors must not be slid on, over, or under each other as scratching will likely occur. Doors must not be dragged across floors or any other surface as scratching will likely occur. Doors must not be subjected to extreme heat, humidity, dryness, direct sunlight or cold. Doors must be stored flat, at least 4” off the floor, on a dry, clean, and well ventilated area protected from the sun, wide ranges of humidity, and abnormal heat or cold. Relative humidity cannot exceed 55% and should be no less than 25%. 2. TOLERANCES Size tolerance: Thickness, length and width plus or minus 1 / 16 ”. Squareness tolerance: diagonal measurement difference will not exceed 1 / 8 ”. Hinge and lockset cutout preparation by Riverside Millwork Group will have a tolerance of plus or minus 1 / 32 ”. Warpage will not be considered a defect unless it exceeds 1 / 4 ” in the plane of the door. For doors 1 3 / 4 ” or thicker, warp will not exceed 1 / 4 ” in doors 3’6” x 7’0” or smaller, nor will it exceed 1 / 4 ” in any section of a door larger than 3’6” x 7’0”. For doors less than 1 3 / 4 ” thick, warp will not exceed 1 / 4 ” doors smaller than 3’0” x 7’0”. Warping is measured by placing a straight edge on the concave face and determining the maximum distance from the straight edge on the concave face and determin- ing the maximum distance from the straight edge to door face. www.riversidemillwork.ca 65 </td>

		<td>INTERIOR MILL DOORS 3. CARE &amp; FINISHING Doors are provided to the customer in good condition, and care has been taken in selecting the wood and machining it to a high quality finish. However, they should not be considered ready for finish when initially received. Ensure that the doors have been allowed to adapt to stable moisture content. Doors must be completely block sanded on all surfaces with 220 grit abrasive sandpaper to remove all handling marks, raised grain and other undesirable blemishes prior to finishing. All exposed surfaces must be sealed, including the top and bottom of door (rails) with a non-water based seal or primer. The door surface should be satisfactory in both smoothness and colour before applying the next coat. Be sure coat is dry and hard before applying the next coat. Always obtain and follow paint manu- facturer’s recommendations. Never attempt to paint doors in moist conditions. Paint will not dry quickly enough and will penetrate into the door to cause expansion. For exterior doors, two coats of high quality exterior grade sealer or primer must be applied as soon as the doors arrive at the job site, or before they go to the job site. Many exterior finishes are designed to penetrate into the wood and protect the surface of the door(s). A urethane finish is suggested for exterior applications. A minimum of 3 coats is suggested. It should also be noted that the stain does not give any protection to the wood but only alters the colour. Only urethane and varnish will protect the wood. As a rule of thumb, an average life expectancy for a finish is 2-3 years. After this point the finish loses its effective- ness and is no longer protecting the door making it susceptible to rotting. The door(s) must be refinished properly on a regular basis to live a long life. Wood is a natural product and reacts differently to changes in humidity and temperature. The components of the door (stiles, rails and panels) expand and contract as these conditions change. When fitting the door(s), please keep these expansions and contractions in mind to prevent the need for re-fitment. The panels may reduce in size leaving an unfinished area exposed. This unfinished area should be touched up with stain and sealer/urethane during the first dry season after installation to eliminate any further exposure of raw wood. 66 DOORS www.riversidemillwork.ca </td>

	<tr id="sr-67">
		<td>INTERIOR MILL DOORS 3. CARE &amp; FINISHING (CONTINUED) Signs that the finish has failed include: Grain raising - When the surface of the wood appears rough or cracked where it was previously smooth. This is an indicator that moisture has been absorbed by the door through the surface of the wood. Discolouration – If the door has taken a grayish hue or discolouration other than that what would naturally occur with some species when exposed to light (cher- ry and sapele will become darker red, walnut will blacken), the door has oxidized due to exposure to moisture or humidity. Flaking or cracking – If cracks in the finish of the urethane or varnish appear, moisture will get into the wood. This should be sanded and refinished immediately when noticed. Due to conditions beyond our control, most finishes on exterior doors deteriorate relatively quickly. Inspect the condition of exterior finishes at least once a year and refinish as often as needed to maintain the protective integrity of the finish. 4. INSTALLATION The integrity or structural strength of the doors must not be compromised in fitting to the opening, or in applying hardware, preparing for lites, louvers, plantons or other detailing. All products must be installed by an experienced door installer. Installer must drill pilot holes before installing hinges. Check screw or hinge manufacturer’s recommendations for size of pilot holes required. Failure to drill pilot holes can result in the door cracking, voiding all warranties. The following quantity and size/type of hinge should be used on the following door sizes: DOOR HEIGHT DOOR THICKNESS NUMBER OF HINGES TYPE OF HINGE SIZE OF HINGE UP TO 6’8’’ 1 3/8 2 OR 3 PLAIN OR BALL BEARING 3X3 OR 3.5X3.5 UP TO 6’8’’ 1 3/4 2 OR 3 PLAIN OR BALL BEARING 3.5X3.5 OR 4X4 6’9” TO 7’6” 1 3/8 3 OR 4 PLAIN OR BALL BEARING 3X3 OR 3.5X3.5 6’9” TO 7’6” 1 3/4 3 OR 4 PLAIN OR BALL BEARING 3.5X3.5 OR 4X4 7’7” TO 8’0” 1 3/8 4 PLAIN OR BALL BEARING 7’7” TO 8’0” 1 3/4 4 BALL BEARING 3X3 OR 3.5X3.5 3.5X3.5 OR 4X4 DOORS www.riversidemillwork.ca 67 INTERIOR INTERIOR DOORS DOORS </td>

		<td>INTERIOR MILL DOORS 4. INSTALLATION (CONTINUED) Clearance between door edges and door frame should be a minimum of 1 / 16 ” on the hinge edge. For latch edge and top rail the clearance should be 1 / 8 ”. Pilot holes must be drilled for all screws that act as hardware attachments. Doors and door frames must be installed plumb, square and level. 5. WARRANTY LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS All Riverside Millwork Group products are guaranteed at the time of shipment. The following items or characteristics are excluded from this warrenty: Unsatisfactory issues caused by failure to follow the receiv- ing, handling, finishing and installation guide set forth herein. Damage and/or defects caused by elements beyond Riverside Millwork Group’s control. Warpage not exceeding 1 / 4 &quot; in any section of a door measuring 3’0” x 7’0”. Warpage refers to any distortion in the door itself – not its relation to the door frame or jamb. Exterior doors hung in locations without adequate overhang protection from the natural elements, or hung in pairs. Doors left unfinished at a job site and exposed to natural elements, heat, cold and/or moisture. 6. DOORS AND CLAIM PROCEDURE All orders must be visually inspected while driver is present. Please check your order for completeness and correctness. Also check if it is in good condition. All complaints must be noted on the packing slip to file a claim. All complaints must be reported within 24 hours of receiving the product. To request a return, please contact our order desk for an RMA form (Return Merchandise Authorization) which must be completed in full to be accepted. 68 INTERIOR DOORS www.riversidemillwork.ca </td>
